Github repo for iPython notebooks and my project paper. This project was part of UC Berkeley Public Health 244, Big Data: A Public Health Perspective where we learn how to deal with big scientific and healthcare data.

The data for this project was provided by Kaggle's Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression with Smartphone Data competition:
